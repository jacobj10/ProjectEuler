#Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms

#Solution
```c++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 1;
	int y = 1;
	int loop = 0;
	int gate = 0;
    int z=1;
    int total=0;
	while (gate==0)
	{
	    if (z%2==0)
	    {
	        total=total+z;
	    }
		z = x + y;
		x = y;
		y = z;
		loop++;
        if (z>4000000)
        {
            gate=1;
        }
	}
	cout<<total<<endl;
}
```
